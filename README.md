# Introduction 
The rapid growth in machine learning (ML) and the increasing need for processing large-scale datasets have highlighted the importance of designing programming languages optimized for these tasks. Existing programming languages often fall short in putting to use the full capability of GPU while maintaining type safety and ease of use, particularly for machine learning workflows. To address these challenges, this project proposes the development of a new programming language and compiler specifically designed for machine learning, with a focus on type safety and GPU-based computation using NVIDIA's CUDA architecture.

The proposed language aims to provide a seamless and efficient environment for handling machine learning tasks, particularly for processing multivariate datasets and performing key algorithms that we will be focusing on now is Linear Regression, with Gradient Descent as the optimization method. This language will offer strict type safety, ensuring robust error checking during compilation to prevent runtime issues, especially for matrix and vector operations, which are critical in ML applications.

By leveraging CUDA for parallel execution, the language will enable highly efficient GPU-based computations, making it apt for handling large datasets and complex models. In addition, it will provide built-in functions for machine learning, simplifying common tasks such as dataset handling, model training, and predictions. A key feature will be its ability to handle multivariate datasets with ease, ensuring that users can implement ML models safely and efficiently.

As a proof of concept, the project will focus on implementing Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning. This will demonstrate the languageâ€™s ability to process real-world datasets, perform model training using gradient descent, and generate accurate predictions. By combining type safety with GPU acceleration, this project aims to create a powerful, efficient, and user-friendly tool for machine learning development.
